                    In Rich Text Editor, you click the toolbar buttons to format the words and the changes are visible immediately. 
                    Markdown is not like that. When you format the word in Markdown format, you need to add Markdown syntax to the word to indicate which words 
                    and phrases should look different from each other

                    Rich Text Editor supports markdown editing when the editorMode set as **markdown** and using both *keyboard interaction* and *toolbar action*, you can apply the formatting to text.

                    We can add our own custom formation syntax for the Markdown formation, [sample link](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/home/).

    <p><b>Injecting Module</b></p>
    <p>Rich Text Editor features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use this MarkDown Preview feature
        we need to inject following services
        <code>ToolbarService, LinkService, ImageService, MarkdownEditorService</code> into the
        <code>@NgModule.providers section</code>.</p>
